## Who I Am

I am a third-year Information Technology (Vietnam–Japan program) student at the University of Information Technology, VNU–HCM, passionate about leveraging technology to optimize everyday life and build user-centric solutions.

Driven by perseverance and creativity, I have:

- 📚 **Self‑studied:** C++, HTML/CSS through weekly tutorials and online resources.
- 🗾 **Learned Japanese:** Following my program curriculum and daily practice, aiming to pass JLPT N3 (short‑term) and N2 (before graduation).
- 🌐 **Explored Web Development:** Building small web projects to refine my coding skills and prepare for real‑world applications.

I thrive in collaborative environments, listen actively, respect diverse viewpoints, and meet deadlines. My strengths include persistence, time‑management, and a creative mindset. I’m always open to exciting internships and innovative projects in web development, full‑stack applications, or anything that drives positive impact.
